# 📚 Wiki Index — Typesetter_doc

> Comprehensive documentation for the **Torah Book Typesetting System** — a web-based tool for typesetting holy books (Torah, Talmud, commentaries) according to traditional Torah printing rules. The system was developed in parallel by three different AI tools, each in its own folder, to enable comparison of approaches.

## 🎯 What is this repository?

The [`SUGINACH/Typesetter_doc`](https://github.com/SUGINACH/Typesetter_doc) repository contains all documentation for the **Torah Book Typesetting System** project — a web tool for typesetting holy books (Torah, Talmud, commentaries) according to traditional Torah printing rules. The project was developed in parallel by three leading AI tools, each in a separate folder, to enable comparison of approaches:

## 🔍 How to use this index

1. **Choose a folder** from the table above or from the sidebar.
2. On each folder page, you'll find a **quick-reference table** with all files and a direct link to each.
3. Scroll down to **"Detailed Index by File"** — there, each file is listed separately with:
   - 📖 **File content summary** (click to expand)
   - 📋 **All headings in the file** in a detailed table — clicking any heading opens the exact location in the file on GitHub.
4. Each heading also shows a line number (clicking `L42` goes to the exact line).

> **Note:** The source files are in Hebrew. Heading text in the indexes is shown in its original Hebrew (since that is the actual heading in the source file). Use the English folder/file descriptions and the [Topical Index](EN-Topical-Index) for navigation in English.
